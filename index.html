                <h1>It's time to say goodbye...</h1>
                <p>It's time to say goodbye... TreasureIsland will be shutting down on the 25th of May 2022.</p>
                <p>Hey everyone, it's been a wild ride. I (sarhatabaot) joined TreasureIsland in 2013, a year after the server first opened. I&#39;ve made many memories and met a lot of amazing people.</p>
                <p>I want to thanks everyone who has been a part of this amazing community. And everyone who has helped along the way.</p>
                <p>I want to thank the one and only: OldScurvyDog, for creating this amazing server and running it for the last 7 years. (+3 behind the scenes)</p>
                <h2>I'd like to thank our crew members:</h2> Butterfly01_nl, Maintizer, Donna_M, bperrin, Mr_Pearl, TheGuyWithPie25, Zwiing, CNTGS, Blue_Moon93</p>

                <h2>But what about the worlds?</h2> The worlds will be available to download for 6 months after the shutdown. A snapshot was taken today on 16th of April. </p>
                <h2>And the website?</h2> The website will stay up for as long as we can. I&#39;m unsure about the state of enjin but we have the best plan right now. We have already made a backup of the galleries &amp; the forums images - Can&#39;t backup
                the posts :frowning: We will be creating a backup website (just in case). That will store the galleries pictures and additional information about the server.</p>
                <h2>And Discord?</h2> The discord server will remain open forever. You may notice some changes in the way it&#39;s structured, channels moving, new channels. A memes channel (probably). As we move to a server focused on everything not just
                Minecraft. You can post any pictures/screenshots you have from the server in the #ti-memories channel.</p>
