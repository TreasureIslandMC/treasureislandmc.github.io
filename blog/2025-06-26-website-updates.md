Hey all! We’ve completely rebuilt our website with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io). While the design looks familiar, everything behind the scenes is now more powerful (and easier for us to maintain!).

## What’s Changed for You

✨ **Faster loading**  
✨ **Better mobile experience**  
✨ **Built-in dark mode** (try the toggle!)  
✨ **Easier to browse content**

## Why We Made the Switch

Previously, every page was hand-coded in **HTML/CSS**, which meant:
- Adding new content required manual formatting
- Consistency was hard to maintain
- Simple updates took more time than they should

Now with Docusaurus and **Markdown**:
- We write posts in simple text files (no more HTML!)
- All styling stays consistent automatically

## Upcoming Features

- Proper tools to find your claims & homes.
- Image gallery
