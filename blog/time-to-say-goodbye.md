# It's time to say goodbye...

It's time to say goodbye... TreasureIsland will be shutting down on the 25th of May 2022.

Hey everyone, it's been a wild ride. I (sarhatabaot) joined TreasureIsland in 2013, a year after the server first opened. I've made many memories and met a lot of amazing people.

I want to thanks everyone who has been a part of this amazing community. And everyone who has helped along the way.

I want to thank the one and only: OldScurvyDog, for creating this amazing server and running it for the last 7 years. (+3 behind the scenes)

## I'd like to thank our crew members:
Butterfly01_nl, Maintizer, Donna_M, bperrin, Mr_Pearl, TheGuyWithPie25, Zwiing, CNTGS, Blue_Moon93

## But what about the worlds?
The worlds will be available to download for 6 months after the shutdown. A snapshot was taken today on 16th of April.

## And the website?
The website will stay up for as long as we can. I'm unsure about the state of enjin but we have the best plan right now. We have already made a backup of the galleries & the forums images - Can't backup the posts :frowning: We will be creating a backup website (just in case). That will store the galleries pictures and additional information about the server.

## And Discord?
The discord server will remain open forever. You may notice some changes in the way it's structured, channels moving, new channels. A memes channel (probably). As we move to a server focused on everything not just Minecraft. You can post any pictures/screenshots you have from the server in the #ti-memories channel.
